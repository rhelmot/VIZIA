//! Events
//!
//! Views communicate with each other and model data via events. An [Event] contains a [Message], as well as metadata to describe how events
//! should propagate through the tree. By default events will propagate up the tree from the target.
//!
//! A [Message] is any static type and is usually an enum. For example:
//! ```
//! enum MyEvent {
//!     ReadDocs,
//!     CloseDocs,    
//! }
//! ```
//! Then, to send an event up the tree from the current entity:
//! ```compile_fail
//! cx.emit(MyEvent::ReadDocs);
//! ```
//! Or, to send an event from the current entity directly to a target:
//! ```compile_fail
//! cx.emit_to(target, MyEvent::ReadDocs);
//! ```
//!
//! Views and Models receive events through the `event()` method of the View or Model traits.
//! The event message must then be downcast to the right type:
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn on_event(&mut self, state: &mut State, entity: Entity, event: &mut Event) {
//!     if let Some(my_event) = event.message.downcast() {
//!         match my_event {
//!             MyEvent::ReadDocs => {
//!                 // Do something
//!             }
//!
//!             MyEvent::CloseDocs => {
//!                 // Do something else
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
